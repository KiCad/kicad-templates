<h1>Orange Pi Zero Plus2</h1>
<h2>Hat</h2>

<p>This project template is the basis of an expansion board (a.k.a. "hat") for the
<a href="http://www.orangepi.org/OrangePiZeroPlus2/" target="blank">
Orange Pi Zero Plus2</a> single-board computer.</p>

<p>This base project includes a PCB edge defined as the same size as the
Orange Pi Zero Plus2 PCB (according to its original mechanical drawing) with the
 connectors placed correctly to align the two boards.
All IO present on the Orange Pi Zero Plus2 board is connected to the project
 through the 0.1" expansion headers (female sockets are on the hat).</p>

<p>The board outline looks like the following:</p>
