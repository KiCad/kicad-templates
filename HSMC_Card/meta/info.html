	<h1>HSMC Card</h1>
	<p>This template provides a basis for PCB that adheres to the Altera/Intel <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/programmable/us/en/pdfs/literature/ds/hsmc_spec.pdf">High Speed Mezzanine Card (HSMC)</a> specification. This is a bare-bones template, as it includes only the Samtec ASP-122952-01 mezzanine connector, required mounting holes, and PCB edges placed in the appropriate locations as defined in the HSMC specification.</p>

	<p>The connector used in this template is the Samtec ASP-122952-01, as recommended in the specification. However, this can be substituted for the Samtec QTH-090-01-L-D-A, at the expense of slightly reduced signal integrity for the dedicated transceiver channels.</p>
